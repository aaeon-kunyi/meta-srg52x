    srg52-image-srg52-buster-srg-3352c.wic.img

5. Booting from SD card ::

    # Under Linux host, insert an unused SD card. Assuming the SD card takes device **/dev/sdX**, use dd to copy the image to it. For example:

    sudo dd if=./build/tmp/deploy/images/srg-3352c/srg52-image-srg52-buster-srg-3352c.wic.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M oflag=sync

    # reminds: **/dev/sdX**, please double confirm which is your SD card.
